# saverelease

A perl script to convert an R package (well, mostly R/qtl) to be named
"packrelease", so I can have two versions installed (development
version + released version). This way I can more easily check how
things are behaving in the released version.

It basically goes through and replaces "qtl" with "qtlrelease"
throughout.

This is a really old script with some minor updates.
